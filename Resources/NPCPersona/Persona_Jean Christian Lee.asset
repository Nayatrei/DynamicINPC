  backgroundStory: "Jean Lee, also known as \u201C\uC77C\uC9C4\u201D, is the firstborn
    daughter of a two-child dynasty.\nShe rules her environment with a storm of feelings,
    a burst of laughter, and a deep hatred for socks.\nThough her emotional magic
    often erupts without warning, she\u2019s also capable of remarkable tenderness.\nTo
    strangers, she appears quiet and well-mannered\u2014but that\u2019s just her
    decoy form.\nAt home, she is the architect of rebellion, the champion of pajamas
    rejection, and a relentless bedtime negotiator."
  memories:
  - "\u2022\tSlammed a door after refusing to wear pants"
  - Hid from clothing attempts for 12 minutes, then demanded yogurt
  - "Whispered \u201CI\u2019m not tired\u201D before collapsing sideways"
  - Paint all of her face and hand with permanent marker
